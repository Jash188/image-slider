## Technologies Used

## Prerequisites

    A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
    Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-slider.git


    Navigate to the project directory: cd image-slider


    Open index.html in your web browser:

    You can open the file directly in your browser by double-clicking the index.html file in the project folder or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" -> "Browser Name."

## Usage

    Manual Navigation:
        Click the "Previous" or "Next" buttons to cycle through the images.
    Automatic Slideshow:
        The slider will automatically change images every 3 seconds (default interval). You can adjust this interval in the JavaScript file.
    Adding Images:
        To add more images, simply include them in the image folder and update the HTML or JavaScript to reference the new images.

## Customization

You can customize the slider by:

    Changing Transition Speed:
        Edit the transitionDuration in the CSS file to increase or decrease the animation speed.

    Adjusting Auto-Slide Interval:
        In the JavaScript file, update the setInterval() value to modify how frequently the images change during the automatic slideshow.

    Adding New Styles:
        Modify the CSS file to apply new styles to the slider (e.g., different button styles, new fonts, or background colors).
